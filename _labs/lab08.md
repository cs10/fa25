# Lab 8: Testing + Proj 3

## Instructions
This worksheet serves as a guide and set of instructions to complete the lab.

- There is **no coding portion** for this lab.  
  You **must** complete the conceptual questions to get full credit for the lab.
- Additionally, [here is the workbook](https://cs10.org/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc/2048-testing/2048.topic&course&novideo&noreading&noassignment) that you can read to complete the lab.
- You can also look at the **‘2048 Lab’** sprite in the [Project 3 Snap File](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=dan%20garcia&ProjectName=BJC%20CS10%20Project%203%3A%202048).
- All material was sourced from the CS10 version of The Beauty and Joy of Computing course.

## Submitting
You will need to complete the **“Lab 8: Testing + Proj 3 (conceptual)”** assignment on Gradescope.

## Objectives
In this lab, we will explore a new higher-order function (HoF) block called `test` to help us understand the basics of testing in computer science.  
This will prepare us for the upcoming Project 3, where you’ll use provided skeleton code to build the game 2048!

By the end of the lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the 2048 assignment spec.
- Understand how the test block works.
- Gain familiarity with the idea of test driven development.
- Write tests that you can use for 2048.

## Required Blocks
- None
