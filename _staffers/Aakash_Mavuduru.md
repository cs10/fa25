Hi! I'm a freshman studying Data Science and Applied Math. I took CS10 last semester and I'm excited to come back as an AI this semester. For me, CS10 was an engaging introduction to computer science that enabled me to tackle the rest of my CS courses at Berkeley. In my free time, I love to cook, listen to music, and shop. I look forward to meeting you all!
