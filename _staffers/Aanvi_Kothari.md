Hey! My name is Aanvi, I’m a senior majoring in CS. I took CS10 in Fall 2022 and it has been one of my favorite classes at Cal so far. I’m excited to be back on CS10 staff for a fifth semester! I genuinely enjoy solving problems and teaching. Outside of school, I love playing golf, kayaking and swimming. Hope to make you all love this class as much as I did!
