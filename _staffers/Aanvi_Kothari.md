Hello! My name is Aanvi, I'm a junior majoring in CS. I took CS10 in Fall 2022 and it has been one of my favourite classes at Cal so far. I'm excited to be back on CS10 staff for a forth semester! I genuinely enjoy solving problems, writing code and teaching. Outside of school, I find joy in golf and swimming.  Hope to make you all love this class as much as I did.
