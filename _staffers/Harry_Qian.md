Hi! I am a Junior majoring in Physics and a minor in EECS; I’ve been on the CS 10 staff team for a couple of semesters and I am very excited to meet you all. I’m from Rome, Italy, so if you have any questions about Italy, stop by and ask! I joined the class with ZERO experience in coding, and I left the class with enough skills to start my CS journey here at Cal. I hope to support you throughout the course!
