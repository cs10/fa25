Hi! I’m Joon, a senior majoring in Economics. I took CS10 in Fall 2024 and I’m excited to return as an Academic Intern this Spring! As an international student with no prior coding experience, CS10 helped me build a strong foundation. I love long movies because I think they have strong plot structures and Interstellar is my favorite. An interesting thing about me is that I like playing games after they lose popularity.
