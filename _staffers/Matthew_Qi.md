Hi! I'm a sophomore majoring in data science and computer science and I'm happy to be an intern this semester! I love design and I'm currently interested in web dev (and binging web dev YouTube videos). I'm also super into chess and Clash Royale, you can catch me staring at games being played on Telegraph and sleeping during chess tournaments!
