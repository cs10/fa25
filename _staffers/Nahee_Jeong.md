Hi all! My name is Nahee, and I'm a sophomore intending to study computer science. I was an Academic Intern for CS10 in my freshman year and a tutor over the summer. I also served as one of the Co-Instructors for the BJC Summer Computer Science Academy. Besides CS, I love dressing up, writing short stories, and drinking Starbucks (my go-to order is iced Americano with a splash of oat milk plus two Splenda packets). Looking forward to meeting you all!
