Hi all! My name is Nahee, and I'm a Junior studying Data Science. I was an Academic Intern for CS10 in my freshman year and a tutor over the summer. I also served as one of the Co-Instructors for the BJC Summer Computer Science Academy and have conducted two BJC workshops. Besides CS, I love dressing up, going on long night walks, and making espresso at home. Feel free to talk to me about literally anything - school, life, pets and people, anime, etc.. Looking forward to meeting you all!
