Hi everyone! I'm a senior majoring in EECS, and I'm excited to be an Academic Intern this semester. I never took CS10 myself, but I remember how much I loved my intro CS class back in high school. It's a huge reason why I ended up in EECS. I hope your time in CS10 is just as fun and inspiring. I really enjoy meeting new people and listening to their stories. Outside of school, I'm into movies and shows, watching sports, and music. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or even if you just want to chat about anything!
