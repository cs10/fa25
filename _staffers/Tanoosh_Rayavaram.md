Hello! My name is Tanoosh and I'm a first year student and my intended majors are Analytics and Statistics. I took CS10 in Fall 2024 and have returned to AI for this class. CS10 was my first introduction to CS and has provided me with a smooth and effective transition into pursuing CS  in my academic career at Berkeley. Outside of school I love hiking, animals, music, and exploring the city. I look forward to meeting everyone!
