Hello, I took CS10 my first semester as Berkeley and am currenly a sophomore studying computer science. I came into Berkeley without any prior CS experience so I know how daunting it can be, so let me know if you have any questions. It is nice to be back and help out the welcoming introduction to CS at Berkeley that is CS10. I'll see you around!
