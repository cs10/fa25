Hi everyone! I'm Jasmine and I'm a freshman intending to double major in cognitive science and rhetoric. If you have no prior experience with programming, never fearâ€”I didn't either when I took CS10 in Fall 2024, but I'm here now! In my free time, I love to read, write fiction, sing, do makeup, and eat chocolate. I'm super excited to help you all navigate the world of programming this spring!
