Hello! My name is Jordan and I'm a junior studying EECS. I'm excited to be an Academic Intern for CS10 and introduce students to the wonderful world of CS! I'm also a Senior Mentor for CSM16B! Outside of academics, I love playing guitar, listening to new music, and drinking coffee/matcha. Hope to see y'all in OH/labs!
