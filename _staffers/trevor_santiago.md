Hi! I'm a sophomore from San Diego, studying Applied Math and a bit of CS. I took CS10 in Fall 2023 as my first computer science class and really made me want to keep exploring CS.  I rememeber the course staff being so helpful and they really created a great learning environment for someone learning how to program.  Outside of school I really enjoy watching basketball, photography, and swimming.  Excited to work with you all this semester!
