Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to be your Head TA this semester. I currently work as an intern for a software company, SAP, the company that sponsors the programming language Snap!, which we'll be using throughout the semester. My passion lies in research, particularly in software development and computer science (CS) education. When I first took this course, I had no programming experience, but I fell in love with it and became a dedicated advocate for CS10 and Snap!.

As a non-traditional student returning to school after a four-year gap, I firmly believe that anyone can learn CS. The field is open to everyone, regardless of age, skill level, or previous experience. My key piece of advice is to embrace failure as part of the learning process. Remember, not knowing something now doesn't mean you won't master it soon. I'm excited to share this journey with you and help you discover the world of computer science!
